Intern Assignment - Candidate Profile Playground
This is a full-stack mini project built with Flask, SQLite, and standard HTML/JS. It's a candidate profile playground that stores profile information and projects in a database, exposes them via REST APIs, and provides a minimal frontend for querying.

üöÄ Live Demo
You can explore a live demo of the application here: https://intern-assignment-y91g.onrender.com

üìÇ Features
REST APIs:

/profile ‚Äî Retrieves candidate profile details (name, email, education, skills, links).

/projects ‚Äî Provides a list of projects with support for filtering by skill and pagination (/projects?skill=python&page=1&limit=3).

/skills/top ‚Äî Lists the top skills from the candidate's profile.

/search ‚Äî Searches projects by title (/search?q=...).

/health ‚Äî A simple liveness check for the application.

Authentication: Write operations (POST /projects) are protected with Basic Auth using environment variables.

Database Management: The application automatically reseeds the SQLite database on startup to handle Render's ephemeral filesystem.

Frontend: A minimal UI is provided for viewing the profile and projects.
